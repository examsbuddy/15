        comment: "Compare button functionality is working correctly. The 'Start Comparing' link opens a modal that shows the 'No phones to compare' message when there are no phones in the compare list. The modal can be closed properly using the close button. No JavaScript errors were detected during testing. The compare functionality works even when compareCount is 0."

        comment: "Mobile navigation bar and debug banner are implemented but have issues. The mobile detection works correctly (window.innerWidth < 768px), but there are two main issues: 1) The debug banner doesn't update correctly when clicking the Compare button - it should show 'Show Compare Modal: true' but doesn't. 2) When clicking the Search button, the app correctly logs 'Navigation clicked: dedicated-search' and 'App.js: setCurrentPage called with: dedicated-search', but the DedicatedSearchPage component throws an error: 'Cannot read properties of null (reading 'brand')'. This is because the searchFilters state is initially null, and the DedicatedSearchPage component tries to access initialFilters.brand without checking if initialFilters is null."

        comment: "Mobile navigation still has issues. The debug banner is visible and shows the current page state correctly, but the mobile bottom navigation is not visible/accessible in mobile view. When examining the DOM, the mobile navigation elements exist but have zero height/width, making them inaccessible for testing. The debug banner shows 'Current Page: home | Compare Count: 0 | Show Compare Modal: false' but clicking on Compare buttons in the product listings doesn't update the modal state. The mobile navigation buttons (Home, Search, Post Ad, Compare, Profile) are in the DOM but not visible or clickable."
