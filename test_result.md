        comment: "Verified the mobile homepage layout improvements. The hero section now shows 'Pakistan's #1 phone marketplace' text. Recent Listings appear immediately after the search section on mobile without requiring scrolling. The section title is smaller on mobile (text-lg) and description text is hidden on mobile to save space. Real phone images are displayed in the listings. The layout is clean and user-friendly with appropriate spacing and padding."
