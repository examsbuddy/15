        comment: "Mobile navigation bar and debug banner are implemented but have issues. The mobile detection works correctly (window.innerWidth < 768px), but there are two main issues: 1) The debug banner doesn't update correctly when clicking the Compare button - it should show 'Show Compare Modal: true' but doesn't. 2) When clicking the Search button, the app correctly logs 'Navigation clicked: dedicated-search' and 'App.js: setCurrentPage called with: dedicated-search', but the DedicatedSearchPage component throws an error: 'Cannot read properties of null (reading 'brand')'. This is because the searchFilters state is initially null, and the DedicatedSearchPage component tries to access initialFilters.brand without checking if initialFilters is null."
