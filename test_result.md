        comment: "Verified the mobile homepage layout improvements. The hero section now shows 'Pakistan's #1 phone marketplace' text. Recent Listings appear immediately after the search section on mobile without requiring scrolling. The section title is smaller on mobile (text-lg) and description text is hidden on mobile to save space. Real phone images are displayed in the listings. The layout is clean and user-friendly with appropriate spacing and padding."

    message: "I've tested the mobile homepage layout improvements. All requirements have been successfully implemented. The hero section shows the correct text, Recent Listings appear immediately after the search section on mobile, and the layout is clean and user-friendly. The mobile-specific improvements (smaller text sizes, hidden description, real phone images) are working as expected."
