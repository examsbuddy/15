        comment: "Verified the mobile homepage layout improvements. The hero section now shows 'Pakistan's #1 phone marketplace' text. Recent Listings appear immediately after the search section on mobile without requiring scrolling. The section title is smaller on mobile (text-lg) and description text is hidden on mobile to save space. Real phone images are displayed in the listings. The layout is clean and user-friendly with appropriate spacing and padding."

The hero text is concise, Recent Listings are immediately visible after search without scrolling, and the mobile-specific styling (reduced padding, smaller text, hidden description) is properly implemented. Real phone images are displayed in the listings."

        comment: "Verified the modernized mobile search bar design. The search bar has a sleeker, more modern appearance with reduced padding (p-3 on mobile vs previous p-6). The search icon is smaller and more refined (w-4 h-4 on mobile). The border is cleaner with a subtle shadow (shadow-lg vs shadow-2xl) and more subtle rounded corners (rounded-xl vs rounded-2xl). The border color is softer (border-white/30 vs border-white/20). Typography and spacing are improved with appropriate text sizes (text-sm on mobile, md:text-base on desktop), clear placeholder text, refined icon positioning (left-3), and more compact button spacing (gap-2 on mobile). The search bar is responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop views. All search functionality is preserved - clicking on the search input opens the search page correctly. The search bar blends seamlessly with the rest of the interface with no console errors."
